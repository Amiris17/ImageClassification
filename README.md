🧠 About This Project
This project is a binary image classification model that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify images as either cats or dogs. The dataset consists of RGB images (100x100x3), and the labels are binary (0 or 1), representing the two classes.

🚀 Key Features
Image preprocessing: normalization and reshaping

CNN architecture with:

2 Convolutional layers + MaxPooling

Dense layers for classification

Binary classification using sigmoid activation

Visual predictions on randomly selected test images

Model evaluation on unseen test data

📦 Technologies Used
Python, NumPy, Matplotlib,TensorFlow,Keras

🖼️ Sample Output
The model displays a random test image and predicts whether it's a cat or a dog, outputting the result clearly.
